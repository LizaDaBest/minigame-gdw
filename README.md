Title: Cube n Balls

Description:
An extremely short minigame meant to waste a bit of time. Defeat the three spheres by destroying them with your projectiles. Don't let them hit you first though, or you must start all over. When you defeat all three cubes, the game also resets so you can play again. Forever. Always. Indefinetely.

Controls: WASD Keys for movement, SPACE bar to shoot vertical projectile
